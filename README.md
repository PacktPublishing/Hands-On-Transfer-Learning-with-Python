**Implement advanced deep learning and neural network models using TensorFlow and Keras**

## What is this book about?
Transfer learning is a machine learning (ML) technique where knowledge gained during training a set of problems can be used to solve other similar problems.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Set up your own DL environment with graphics processing unit (GPU) and Cloud support
* Delve into transfer learning principles with ML and DL models
* Explore various DL architectures, including CNN, LSTM, and capsule networks
* Learn about data and network representation and loss functions
* Get to grips with models and strategies in transfer learning
